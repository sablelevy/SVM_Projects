SVM Project for MATH6350: Statistical Learning and Data Mining, Fall 2019

Project 1: SVM classification for simulated data.  

Tasks Performed:
	•	Formed Data using uniform distribution
	•	Defined hyperplane by polynomial with degree 4 and used that as separating hyperplane
	•	Standardized data
	•	Split data into test and train sets 
	•	Linear SVM 
	•	Tune the Cost parameter 
	•	Fit model with best parameters 
	•	Look at results of model via Confusion Matrix, Histogram Plots, and Scatter Plots
	•	Radial Kernel
	•	Tune the parameters Cost and Gamma
	•	Fit model with best parameters 
	•	Look at results of model via Confusion Matrix, Histogram Plots, and Scatter Plots
	•	Polynomial Kernel
	•	Tune the parameters Cost, Coef0, and degree
